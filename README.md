Guessing Game Functions: 

1. generate_secret_number()
Purpose: Generate a random secret number for the player to guess.
Parameters: None.
Return Type: u32 (unsigned 32-bit integer).
Behavior: Returns a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

2. prompt_guess()
Purpose: Prompt the user to input their guess.
Parameters: None.
Return Type: u32 (unsigned 32-bit integer).
Behavior: Reads a line of input from the user and parses it into an integer. If the input cannot be parsed or is out of range (not between 1 and 100), it prompts the user again until a valid guess is provided.

3. check_guess(guess: u32, secret_number: u32) -> Ordering
Purpose: Compare the player's guess with the secret number.
Parameters:
guess: The player's guess (unsigned 32-bit integer).
secret_number: The secret number generated by the game (unsigned 32-bit integer).
Return Type: Ordering enum variant.
Behavior: Compares the player's guess with the secret number and returns:
Ordering::Less if the guess is less than the secret number.
Ordering::Greater if the guess is greater than the secret number.
Ordering::Equal if the guess is equal to the secret number.

4. print_result(result: Ordering, secret_number: u32)
Purpose: Print the result of the player's guess.
Parameters:
result: The result of comparing the guess with the secret number (Ordering enum variant).
secret_number: The secret number generated by the game (unsigned 32-bit integer).
Return Type: None.
Behavior: Prints a message to the console based on the result of the comparison:
"Too low!" if the guess is less than the secret number.
"Too high!" if the guess is greater than the secret number.
"Congratulations! You guessed the number correctly: [secret_number]" if the guess is equal to the secret number.
